		<h1>Understanding the HTTP Protocol</h1>

		<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a fundamental protocol of the Internet, enabling the transfer of data
			between a client and a server. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

			HTTP provides a standard between a web browser and a web server to establish communication. It is a set of
			rules for transferring data from one computer to another. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia
			files are shared on the World Wide Web. Whenever a web user opens their web browser, the user indirectly
			uses HTTP. It is an application protocol that is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
			systems.
		</p>

			<h2>HTTP Request-Response Cycle</h2>
			<p>HTTP is a request-response protocol, which means that for every request sent by a client (typically a web
				browser), the server responds with a corresponding response. The basic flow of an HTTP request-response
				cycle is as follows:

			<ul>
				<li> Client sends an HTTP request: The client (usually a web browser) initiates the process by sending
					an HTTP request to the server. This request includes a request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,
					etc.), the target URI (Uniform Resource Identifier, e.g., a URL), headers, and an optional request
					body.
				</li>
				<li> Server processes the request: The server receives the request and processes it based on the
					requested method and resource. This may involve retrieving data from a database, executing
					server-side scripts, or performing other operations.
				</li>
				<li> Server sends an HTTP response: After processing the request, the server sends an HTTP response back
					to the client. The response includes a status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), response headers,
					and an optional response body containing the requested data or content.
				</li>
				<li> Client processes the response: The client receives the server’s response and processes it
					accordingly. For example, if the response contains an HTML page, the browser will render and display
					it. If it’s an image or other media file, the browser will display or handle it appropriately.
				</li>
			</ul>

			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The client sends an HTTP request to the server.</li>
				<li>The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>HTTP Methods</h2>
		<p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.
			Here are the common HTTP methods:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>GET</strong> – Requests data from a server (read).</li>
			<li><strong>POST</strong> – Sends data to a server to create/update a resource.</li>
			<li><strong>PUT</strong> – Updates an existing resource.</li>
			<li><strong>DELETE</strong> – Deletes a resource.</li>
			<li><strong>HEAD</strong> – Same as GET but only retrieves the headers.</li>
		</ul>

		</div>

		<h2>HTTP Request Structure</h2>
		<p>An HTTP request is composed of the following key elements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Request Line</strong> – Contains the method (e.g., GET), the resource path, and the HTTP
				version.</li>
			<li><strong>Headers</strong> – Provide meta-information (e.g., content type, authorization).</li>
			<li><strong>Body</strong> (optional) – Contains the data to be sent (usually in POST or PUT requests).</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="illustration">
			<h2>HTTP Request Example</h2>

		</div>

		<h2>HTTP Response Structure</h2>
		<p>Once the server processes the request, it sends an HTTP response back to the client. The response includes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Status Line</strong> – Contains the HTTP version, status code, and status message (e.g., 200
				OK).</li>
			<li><strong>Headers</strong> – Similar to the request, headers provide meta-information.</li>
			<li><strong>Body</strong> – The actual data requested by the client (e.g., HTML content).</li>
		</ul>

		</div>

		<h2>HTTP Status Codes</h2>
		<p>HTTP status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request. They are grouped into five
			categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>1xx Informational</strong> – The request was received, continuing process.</li>
			<li><strong>2xx Success</strong> – The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.</li>
			<li><strong>3xx Redirection</strong> – Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.</li>
			<li><strong>4xx Client Error</strong> – The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.</li>
			<li><strong>5xx Server Error</strong> – The server failed to fulfill a valid request.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>HTTPS: A Secure Version of HTTP</h2>
		<p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses encryption through SSL/TLS
			protocols to secure the communication between the client and server. This ensures that sensitive information
			like login credentials and payment details are protected from eavesdroppers.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>HTTP is a core protocol that powers the web, enabling the communication between clients (web browsers) and
			servers. Understanding how it works, along with its methods and structure, is essential for web development
			and network communication. As the web evolves, the adoption of HTTPS ensures that this communication remains
			secure.</p>
