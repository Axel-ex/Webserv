			<p>This website serves as a comprehensive resource for
				understanding the intricacies of our webserver implementation. Here, you will find detailed information
				covering essential topics such as server architecture, the HTTP protocol, socket programming, request
				handling, CGI implementation, and logging and monitoring.</p>
			<p>Our project aims to create a robust webserver capable of efficiently handling various types of client
				requests while adhering to industry standards. Through this documentation, we invite you to explore the
				design choices we made, the challenges we encountered, and the solutions we devised during the
				development process.</p>

			<h3>Project Division</h3>
			<p>While each member of our team contributed to the overall project, we each took on specific
				responsibilities to ensure a well-structured and organized development process:</p>
			<div class='center-table'>

				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Name</th>
							<th>GitHub Username</th>
							<th>Responsibilities</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Ebenezer Marquezine</td>
							<td>ebmarque</td>
							<td>Focused primarily on the implementation of CGI (Common Gateway Interface) and cookie
								management. Ebenezer handled the intricacies of processing dynamic requests, ensuring
								that our server could handle various data inputs effectively and efficiently.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Tiago Moutinho</td>
							<td>tmoutinh</td>
							<td>Took charge of request handling, working to ensure that incoming requests were processed
								accurately and promptly. Tiagoâ€™s contributions were crucial in establishing a seamless
								communication flow between the client and server.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Axel Chabrerie</td>
							<td>Axel-ex</td>
							<td>Specialized in socket programming and the overall server structure. Axel was responsible
								for developing the core code classes and implementing various design patterns that
								enhanced the server's functionality and maintainability.</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</div>
			<p>Through collaborative efforts and a clear division of tasks, our team has successfully developed a
				webserver that meets modern standards while allowing for future enhancements. We hope this documentation
				provides valuable insights into our project and inspires further exploration in webserver technology.
