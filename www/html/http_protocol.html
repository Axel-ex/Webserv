		<h1>Understanding the HTTP Protocol</h1>

		<p>The <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b> is a cornerstone of modern internet communication, acting as
			the
			primary protocol that facilitates the exchange of data between clients (such as web browsers) and servers.
			It serves as the foundation for data transmission across the <b>World Wide Web</b>, establishing a standardized
			method for devices to request and deliver web content.
		</p>

		At its core, HTTP defines the rules and conventions for how information is transmitted, enabling seamless
		interactions between web browsers and servers. Through this protocol, a wide variety of content—including
		text, images, videos, and other multimedia—can be exchanged over the internet, ensuring users can access the
		content they need.
		<p>
			HTTP operates within an application layer of network protocols, designed specifically for distributed,
			collaborative, hypermedia systems. Each time a user navigates to a website or opens a web-based application,
			they engage with HTTP, often without even realizing it. When a user enters a URL or clicks a link, their
			browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which responds by delivering the appropriate resources—such as
			an HTML page, image, or other media files.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a stateless protocol, HTTP treats each request as an independent transaction, meaning no session data is
			retained between interactions unless specifically managed through techniques like cookies or session
			tracking. This characteristic of HTTP allows it to be highly scalable, supporting the vast number of global
			users accessing web services simultaneously.
		</p>

		<p>
			HTTP has undergone several evolutions since its inception. The most widely adopted version, HTTP/1.1,
			introduced persistent connections and pipelining, significantly improving performance. More recently, HTTP/2
			and HTTP/3 have been developed to further enhance speed, security, and efficiency by introducing features
			like multiplexing, header compression, and improved congestion control.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In essence, HTTP is not just a protocol for transmitting data but a fundamental enabler of the
		interconnected world we experience today, powering the dynamic, media-rich content we interact with on a
		daily basis. It remains an indispensable part of the internet's infrastructure, underpinning everything from
		simple webpage requests to complex, real-time web applications.

			<h2>HTTP Request-Response Cycle</h2>
			<p>HTTP is a request-response protocol, which means that for every request sent by a client (typically a web
				browser), the server responds with a corresponding response. The basic flow of an HTTP request-response
				cycle is as follows:

			<ul>
				<li> Client sends an HTTP request: The client (usually a web browser) initiates the process by sending
					an HTTP request to the server. This request includes a request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,
					etc.), the target URI (Uniform Resource Identifier, e.g., a URL), headers, and an optional request
					body.
				</li>
				<li> Server processes the request: The server receives the request and processes it based on the
					requested method and resource. This may involve retrieving data from a database, executing
					server-side scripts, or performing other operations.
				</li>
				<li> Server sends an HTTP response: After processing the request, the server sends an HTTP response back
					to the client. The response includes a status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), response headers,
					and an optional response body containing the requested data or content.
				</li>
				<li> Client processes the response: The client receives the server’s response and processes it
					accordingly. For example, if the response contains an HTML page, the browser will render and display
					it. If it’s an image or other media file, the browser will display or handle it appropriately.
				</li>
			</ul>

			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The client sends an HTTP request to the server.</li>
				<li>The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>HTTP Methods</h2>
		<p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.
			Here are the common HTTP methods:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>GET</strong> – Requests data from a server (read).</li>
			<li><strong>POST</strong> – Sends data to a server to create/update a resource.</li>
			<li><strong>PUT</strong> – Updates an existing resource.</li>
			<li><strong>DELETE</strong> – Deletes a resource.</li>
			<li><strong>HEAD</strong> – Same as GET but only retrieves the headers.</li>
		</ul>

		</div>

		<h2>HTTP Request Structure</h2>
		<p>An HTTP request is composed of the following key elements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Request Line</strong> – Contains the method (e.g., GET), the resource path, and the HTTP
				version.</li>
			<li><strong>Headers</strong> – Provide meta-information (e.g., content type, authorization).</li>
			<li><strong>Body</strong> (optional) – Contains the data to be sent (usually in POST or PUT requests).</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="illustration">
			<h2>HTTP Request Example</h2>

		</div>

		<h2>HTTP Response Structure</h2>
		<p>Once the server processes the request, it sends an HTTP response back to the client. The response includes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Status Line</strong> – Contains the HTTP version, status code, and status message (e.g., 200
				OK).</li>
			<li><strong>Headers</strong> – Similar to the request, headers provide meta-information.</li>
			<li><strong>Body</strong> – The actual data requested by the client (e.g., HTML content).</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="illustration">
			<img src="images/http-response-example.png" alt="Example of an HTTP Response">
		</div>

		<h2>HTTP Status Codes</h2>
		<p>HTTP status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request. They are grouped into five
			categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>1xx Informational</strong> – The request was received, continuing process.</li>
			<li><strong>2xx Success</strong> – The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.</li>
			<li><strong>3xx Redirection</strong> – Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.</li>
			<li><strong>4xx Client Error</strong> – The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.</li>
			<li><strong>5xx Server Error</strong> – The server failed to fulfill a valid request.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>HTTPS: A Secure Version of HTTP</h2>
		<p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses encryption through SSL/TLS
			protocols to secure the communication between the client and server. This ensures that sensitive information
			like login credentials and payment details are protected from eavesdroppers.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>HTTP is a core protocol that powers the web, enabling the communication between clients (web browsers) and
			servers. Understanding how it works, along with its methods and structure, is essential for web development
			and network communication. As the web evolves, the adoption of HTTPS ensures that this communication remains
			secure.</p>
